",Homo sapiens,"cell type: In-vitro human ESCs
",total RNA,"Posteriorized embryonic-like sacs (48 hours) within the microfluidic devices, amniotic-like cells derived using transwell and H9 cells were dissociated into single cells by incubating in Accutase for 1 hour. Cells from posteriorized embryonic-like sacs were lysed and barcoded with 10x Chromium Controller Instrument (10x Genomics). Amniotic-like cells derived using transwell and H9 cells were mixed at a 2:1 ratio, before lysed and barcoded with 10x Chromium Controller Instrument.
cDNA library was constructed according to the standard 10x Genomics scRNA-seq library construction protocol (Single Cell 3' v2). The libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 4000 with paired-end sequencing (One sample per flow cell).
