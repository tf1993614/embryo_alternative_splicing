embryo growth conditions: in-vitro
protocol day: 4
","At day 4, ~80 human SEMs were pooled into one lane of the 10X chromium chip, while at day 6 and 8, a pool of ~50 SEMs were sequenced per lane. All SEMs samples were processed including extraembryonic compartments without any dissection. SEMs were dissociated with Trypsin-EDTA solution C (0.05%) for 10 minutes (Biological Industries; 030501B). Trypsin was neutralized using media with 10% FBS, and cells were washed and resuspended in 1x PBS with 400 µg/ml BSA. Cell suspension was filtered with a 100 µm cell strainer to remove cell clumps. Cell viability of at least 90% was determined by trypan blue staining for all samples. Cells were diluted at a final concentration of 1000 cells/µL in 1x PBS with 400 µg/ml BSA.
","All human SEMs analyzed by scRNA-seq were generated by co-aggregating WT WIBR3 naïve ESC lines grown in HENSM with RCL-induced or BAPJ-induced WT cells.

","Demultiplexing was done with bcl2fastq2
Alignment and quantification of single cell features was done with cellranger/7.1.0 counts
Aggregation of multiple GEM wells was done using cellranger aggr
Cells with under 1000 expressing genes, over 8000 expressing genes or over 15% mitochondrial gene expression were filtered out for the rest of the analysis.
Seurat integrated analysis and anchoring of 3 individual samples was performed and then normalized by log-normalization using a scale-factor of 10,000. The top 2,000 variable genes were identified by the variance stabilizing transformation method, and subsequently scaled and centered.
Assembly: hg38
Supplementary files format and content: filtered_feature_bc_matrix.tar.gz includes CellRanger output files that were used for the analysis. In addition, there are 3 different matrices created using Seurat 4.3.0: raw_counts - contains raw counts of all genes across all cells, norm_data- contains normalized counts of all genes across filtered cells, norm_meta_annotations.csv contains meta-data of all genes after filtering, normalization and clustering by Seurat.
The order of the samples in filtered_feature_bc_matrix.tgz is: 1 - W3_SEM_Day4, 2 - W3_SEM_Day6, 3 - W3_SEM_Day8.
