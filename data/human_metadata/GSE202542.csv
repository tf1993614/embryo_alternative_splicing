",total RNA,"The samples were dissociated with TrypLE for 15-30 min at 37 °C until they completely dissociated into single cells assessed by light microscopy. The dissociation solution was thoroughly washed, then samples were loaded for capture onthe 10x Chromium platform using the Single Cell 3′ v3 reagents. cDNA was synthesized and amplified according to the manufacturer's instructions (10X Genomics). The resulting libraries were sequenced on the Nova-seq platform.

","Data was aligned to hg19 using Cellranger and quality processed using the default settings to generate the counts file. Single cell data was further processed using Scanpy. Cells expressing >15,000 total genes or >20% mitochondrial genes were removed. Processed data here is generated using the write_csvs function in Scanpy, which split the dataframe into three files: the count matrix (.X), the annotation of features (.var) file, and the annotation of observations (.obs) file.
