",Homo sapiens,"cell line: RUES2-GLR
cell type: embryonic stem cell
genotype: WT
treatment: peri-gastruloid formation protocol
",total RNA,"Day 11 peri-gastruloids were isolated via filter straining and centifugation before digestion in TrypLE. The resulting cell suspension was filtered and washed before loading into a 10X chromium chip.
10X Library preparation according to 10X Genomicsâ€™ protocol of Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v3.1 (Dual Index). Illumnia NovaSeq 2000 (138 max bps P2) with 10X Genomics Single cell 3' v3
",RNA-Seq,transcriptomic single cell,cDNA,NextSeq 2000,"All processing was done with the 10X cellranger ""count"" function using cellranger 7.1.0. Default parameters were used.
Assembly: GRCh38-3.0.0
Supplementary files format and content: The filtered scRNA count matrix is in the .h5 file format, and contains all confidently mapped reads for all cells.
