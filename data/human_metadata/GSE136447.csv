","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1).

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day. The components of the mIVC1 and mIVC2 system are modifications of IVC1 and IVC2, which had been used to culture human attached embryos on the dish: mIVC1: Advanced DMEM/F12 (12634-010, Thermo Fischer Scientific) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) DFBS (defined fetal bovine serum)(bs-0003, Biosera), 2 mM L-glutamine (25030, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X ITS-X (51500-056, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 8 nM β-estradiol (E8875, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 ng/ml progesterone (P0130, Sigma-Aldrich), 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate (L7900， SigmaAldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate（P4562, Sigma-Aldrich） and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck). mIVC2: Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 30% (vol/vol) KOSR (knockout serum replacement) (A3181501, Thermo Fischer Scientific), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X ITS-X, 8 nM β-estradiol, 200 ng/ml progesterone, 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (P4562, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck).

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1).

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day. The components of the mIVC1 and mIVC2 system are modifications of IVC1 and IVC2, which had been used to culture human attached embryos on the dish: mIVC1: Advanced DMEM/F12 (12634-010, Thermo Fischer Scientific) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) DFBS (defined fetal bovine serum)(bs-0003, Biosera), 2 mM L-glutamine (25030, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X ITS-X (51500-056, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 8 nM β-estradiol (E8875, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 ng/ml progesterone (P0130, Sigma-Aldrich), 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate (L7900， SigmaAldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate（P4562, Sigma-Aldrich） and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck). mIVC2: Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 30% (vol/vol) KOSR (knockout serum replacement) (A3181501, Thermo Fischer Scientific), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X ITS-X, 8 nM β-estradiol, 200 ng/ml progesterone, 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (P4562, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck).

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1).

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1).

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day. The components of the mIVC1 and mIVC2 system are modifications of IVC1 and IVC2, which had been used to culture human attached embryos on the dish: mIVC1: Advanced DMEM/F12 (12634-010, Thermo Fischer Scientific) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) DFBS (defined fetal bovine serum)(bs-0003, Biosera), 2 mM L-glutamine (25030, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X ITS-X (51500-056, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 8 nM β-estradiol (E8875, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 ng/ml progesterone (P0130, Sigma-Aldrich), 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate (L7900， SigmaAldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate（P4562, Sigma-Aldrich） and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck). mIVC2: Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 30% (vol/vol) KOSR (knockout serum replacement) (A3181501, Thermo Fischer Scientific), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X ITS-X, 8 nM β-estradiol, 200 ng/ml progesterone, 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (P4562, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck).

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1).

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day. The components of the mIVC1 and mIVC2 system are modifications of IVC1 and IVC2, which had been used to culture human attached embryos on the dish: mIVC1: Advanced DMEM/F12 (12634-010, Thermo Fischer Scientific) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) DFBS (defined fetal bovine serum)(bs-0003, Biosera), 2 mM L-glutamine (25030, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X ITS-X (51500-056, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 8 nM β-estradiol (E8875, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 ng/ml progesterone (P0130, Sigma-Aldrich), 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate (L7900， SigmaAldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate（P4562, Sigma-Aldrich） and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck). mIVC2: Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 30% (vol/vol) KOSR (knockout serum replacement) (A3181501, Thermo Fischer Scientific), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X ITS-X, 8 nM β-estradiol, 200 ng/ml progesterone, 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (P4562, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck).

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1).

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day. The components of the mIVC1 and mIVC2 system are modifications of IVC1 and IVC2, which had been used to culture human attached embryos on the dish: mIVC1: Advanced DMEM/F12 (12634-010, Thermo Fischer Scientific) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) DFBS (defined fetal bovine serum)(bs-0003, Biosera), 2 mM L-glutamine (25030, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X ITS-X (51500-056, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 8 nM β-estradiol (E8875, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 ng/ml progesterone (P0130, Sigma-Aldrich), 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate (L7900， SigmaAldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate（P4562, Sigma-Aldrich） and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck). mIVC2: Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 30% (vol/vol) KOSR (knockout serum replacement) (A3181501, Thermo Fischer Scientific), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X ITS-X, 8 nM β-estradiol, 200 ng/ml progesterone, 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (P4562, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck).

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1).

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day. The components of the mIVC1 and mIVC2 system are modifications of IVC1 and IVC2, which had been used to culture human attached embryos on the dish: mIVC1: Advanced DMEM/F12 (12634-010, Thermo Fischer Scientific) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) DFBS (defined fetal bovine serum)(bs-0003, Biosera), 2 mM L-glutamine (25030, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X ITS-X (51500-056, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 8 nM β-estradiol (E8875, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 ng/ml progesterone (P0130, Sigma-Aldrich), 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate (L7900， SigmaAldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate（P4562, Sigma-Aldrich） and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck). mIVC2: Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 30% (vol/vol) KOSR (knockout serum replacement) (A3181501, Thermo Fischer Scientific), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X ITS-X, 8 nM β-estradiol, 200 ng/ml progesterone, 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (P4562, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck).

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1).

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day. The components of the mIVC1 and mIVC2 system are modifications of IVC1 and IVC2, which had been used to culture human attached embryos on the dish: mIVC1: Advanced DMEM/F12 (12634-010, Thermo Fischer Scientific) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) DFBS (defined fetal bovine serum)(bs-0003, Biosera), 2 mM L-glutamine (25030, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X ITS-X (51500-056, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 8 nM β-estradiol (E8875, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 ng/ml progesterone (P0130, Sigma-Aldrich), 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate (L7900， SigmaAldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate（P4562, Sigma-Aldrich） and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck). mIVC2: Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 30% (vol/vol) KOSR (knockout serum replacement) (A3181501, Thermo Fischer Scientific), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X ITS-X, 8 nM β-estradiol, 200 ng/ml progesterone, 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (P4562, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck).

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1).

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day. The components of the mIVC1 and mIVC2 system are modifications of IVC1 and IVC2, which had been used to culture human attached embryos on the dish: mIVC1: Advanced DMEM/F12 (12634-010, Thermo Fischer Scientific) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) DFBS (defined fetal bovine serum)(bs-0003, Biosera), 2 mM L-glutamine (25030, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X ITS-X (51500-056, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 8 nM β-estradiol (E8875, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 ng/ml progesterone (P0130, Sigma-Aldrich), 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate (L7900， SigmaAldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate（P4562, Sigma-Aldrich） and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck). mIVC2: Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 30% (vol/vol) KOSR (knockout serum replacement) (A3181501, Thermo Fischer Scientific), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X ITS-X, 8 nM β-estradiol, 200 ng/ml progesterone, 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (P4562, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck).

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1).

","Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal. Before embryos thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 (10132, Vitrolife) was equilibrated in a 4-well plate (176740, Nunc) over night. First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day. The components of the mIVC1 and mIVC2 system are modifications of IVC1 and IVC2, which had been used to culture human attached embryos on the dish: mIVC1: Advanced DMEM/F12 (12634-010, Thermo Fischer Scientific) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) DFBS (defined fetal bovine serum)(bs-0003, Biosera), 2 mM L-glutamine (25030, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X ITS-X (51500-056, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 8 nM β-estradiol (E8875, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 ng/ml progesterone (P0130, Sigma-Aldrich), 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate (L7900， SigmaAldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate（P4562, Sigma-Aldrich） and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck). mIVC2: Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 30% (vol/vol) KOSR (knockout serum replacement) (A3181501, Thermo Fischer Scientific), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X ITS-X, 8 nM β-estradiol, 200 ng/ml progesterone, 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (P4562, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck).

First, 0.5ml G-2 medium was added into the well and 0.25 ml mineral oil (10029, Vitrolife) covered the G2 medium. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post fertilization) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (VT102, Kitazato Corporation) by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1).

After cultured indrops of the equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the zona pellucida. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium two times and then transferred to in vitro culture medium. In vitro three-dimensional culture of human embryos. The embryos without zona pellucida were cultured in a low attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) with one embryo and 150µL extended medium each well. The embryo culture condition was the following: 37.2℃, 6% CO2 and saturated humidity. First, at day 6-8 post fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was modified in vitro culture medium 1 (mIVC1). At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by modified in vitro culture medium 2 (mIVC2). At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells with the mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel (354234, Corning). After that, 50% culture medium was replaced by pre-equilibrated mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day. The components of the mIVC1 and mIVC2 system are modifications of IVC1 and IVC2, which had been used to culture human attached embryos on the dish: mIVC1: Advanced DMEM/F12 (12634-010, Thermo Fischer Scientific) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) DFBS (defined fetal bovine serum)(bs-0003, Biosera), 2 mM L-glutamine (25030, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X ITS-X (51500-056, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 8 nM β-estradiol (E8875, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 ng/ml progesterone (P0130, Sigma-Aldrich), 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate (L7900， SigmaAldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate（P4562, Sigma-Aldrich） and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck). mIVC2: Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 30% (vol/vol) KOSR (knockout serum replacement) (A3181501, Thermo Fischer Scientific), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X ITS-X, 8 nM β-estradiol, 200 ng/ml progesterone, 25 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A7250, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.22% (vol/vol) sodium lactate, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (P4562, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10µM Y27632 (S1049, Selleck).
",total RNA,"Isolation of single cells. The embryos were washed in PBS for 3 times, washed in 0.25% trypsin (T4799; SigmaAldrich) 2 times, incubated with 0.25% trypsin for around 15 min at 37 °C, and terminated by DFBS. Embryo was dissociated into single cells by repeated pipetting and dispersed in 1% DFBS/PBS. A single cell was pipetted into a PCR tube. All operations above were performed under the Nikon SMZ645 microscopy.
The synthesis and amplification of full-length cDNAs were performed following Smart-seq2 protocol4. Briefly, single cells were washed in DPBS (Gibco 14190-144) and picked into lysis buffer using Pasteur pipettes under a dissecting microscope. Reversetranscription reactions and pre-amplification were performed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen 18064-014) and KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems KK2601), respectively. The quality of the cDNAs were evaluated by Bioanalyzer 2100. Library construction and sequencing were performed by Annoroad Gene Technology (http://www.annoroad.com/) or BGI (https://www.bgi.com/). Sequencing was performed on Illumina X-ten platform or BGISEQ-500 sequencing platform (BGI, Shenzhen, China). Pair-end reads were got and the number of the reads were more than 7 M for every single cell
