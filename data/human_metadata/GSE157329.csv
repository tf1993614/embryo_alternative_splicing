","We dissected each embryo on ice into four main sections, i.e., head, trunk, viscera and limb. After the dissection, each sample was placed into separate tubes, washed twice with cold PBS, cut into pieces and suspended in 300μl Hibernate-E medium with 0.05mg/ml Liberase TM (Roche).
","Aborted embryos from donations were washed with PBS, transferred into cold Hibernate-E medium (Gibco) and immediately transported to the laboratory. Embryos with good quality were staged based on anatomical characters.
",polyA RNA,"Samples were incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes and were pipetted up and down thoroughly and gently every 3 minutes. To quench the dissociation, we added 300μl FBS into each tube and centrifuge cells at 300xg for 5 min at 4°C. Cells were then resuspended in 500μl cold PBS, filtered through a 35μm strainer. Single cells were subsequently washed twice with cold PBS, centrifuged at 300xg for 5 min at 4°C and resuspended in cold PBS.
To generate sequencing libraries, a suspension of 10,000 single cells per sample was processed following the 10x Genomics protocol using Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v2 (10x Genomics).
",RNA-Seq,transcriptomic,cDNA,Illumina NovaSeq 6000,"Raw reads were demultiplexed, filtered and mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using Cell Ranger 3.0.2 with default settings. The filtered feature-barcode matrices generated by Cell Ranger were used for further analysis.
To exclude low-quality cells and doublets, cells with fewer than 1000 genes or over 60000 UMIs were discarded. The expression matrix was normalized into UMIs per 10000 by size factors.
Iterative clustering was performed to identify cell types. First, we partitioned cells into main clusters with Seurat (r=0.5, PCs=20) using only transcription factors in highly variable genes (HVGs). Second, for each main cluster, we performed one or two rounds of clustering with HVGs of the particular cluster.

To exclude low-quality cells and doublets, cells with fewer than 1000 genes or over 60000 UMIs were discarded. The expression matrix was normalized into UMIs per 10000 by size factors.
Iterative clustering was performed to identify cell types. First, we partitioned cells into main clusters with Seurat (r=0.5, PCs=20) using only transcription factors in highly variable genes (HVGs). Second, for each main cluster, we performed one or two rounds of clustering with HVGs of the particular cluster.

To generate sequencing libraries, a suspension of 10,000 single cells per sample was processed following the 10x Genomics protocol using Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v2 (10x Genomics).
",RNA-Seq,transcriptomic,cDNA,Illumina NovaSeq 6000,"Raw reads were demultiplexed, filtered and mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using Cell Ranger 3.0.2 with default settings. The filtered feature-barcode matrices generated by Cell Ranger were used for further analysis.
To exclude low-quality cells and doublets, cells with fewer than 1000 genes or over 60000 UMIs were discarded. The expression matrix was normalized into UMIs per 10000 by size factors.
Iterative clustering was performed to identify cell types. First, we partitioned cells into main clusters with Seurat (r=0.5, PCs=20) using only transcription factors in highly variable genes (HVGs). Second, for each main cluster, we performed one or two rounds of clustering with HVGs of the particular cluster.
