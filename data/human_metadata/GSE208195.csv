","AggreWell plate is prepared as described in our previously established methods (Sozen et a. 2018 and 2019). The hPSCs were dissociated into single cells with accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) incubation at 37 °C for 3 to 4 minutes. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 3 minutes at 1,000 r.p.m. and resuspended in hEP media from Yang et al., 2017. MEFs depleted on gelatin coated plates at 37 °C in 5% CO2 on gelatinized tissue-culture-grade plates. Single cells resuspended in SDM were added dropwise to the AggreWell.

",polyA RNA,"The extra-embryoids that exhibited an inner and outer compartment organization under brightfield are collected on day 4 and day 6 for single-cell isolation. Roughly 200 aggregates per time-points were serially washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS and briefly washed before incubation in 200 mL TrypLE (GIBCO) and incubation at 37ºC. At five-minute intervals, structures were dissociated by pipetting under a stereomicroscope and returned to incubation until confirmed to be predominantly single-cell suspension. Although the epithelial cells of the internal compartment dissociated readily, additional time was required to fully dissociate cells in the outside layer due to the appearance of a more extensive extracellular matrix. Once dissociated, cells were collected in a total of 1 mL 0.1% BSA in PBS and filtered using a FlowMi™ cell strainer (40 mM, Scienceware®) and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 rpm. After two washes, single-cell suspensions were resuspended at a set volume, counted using a standard hemocytometer, and adjusted to 1,000 cells per μL. 
16,500 single cells for each time point were loaded onto a Chromium Controller (10x genomics) to generate single-cell transcriptomes using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3ʹ platform according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics).

","Prior to more detailed analyses, the overall runs were validated according to the initial CellRanger outputs, including ~30,000 mean transcripts per cell and 3,800 median genes per cell. The overall fraction of transcripts represented by mitochondrial genes was less than 5%. A total of 22,054 cells were obtained for day 4 and day 6 aggregates. Day 4 consisted of 10,826 cells, and Day 6 aggregates comprised 11,228 cells. 
After initial validation of the library quality, preliminary clustering and filtering steps were taken to identify and eliminate library preparation and sequencing artifacts. These include the removal of cells with >10% mitochondrial transcript counts to discard nonviable cells (1493 cells, 6.7% of total), >27500 transcript counts to remove likely doublets (1069 cells, 4.8% of total), and <3430 transcripts to remove low-quality cells (2013 cells, 9.0% of total). A total of 19,247 cells were preserved at this stage, corresponding to 85.8% of total cells. Data for days 4 and 6 were processed separately using the Seurat v.4.0.1 package pipeline in R v.4.0.3.
Processing steps include library log normalization, data scaling, and linear dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis (PCA) using the most highly variable genes in the sample, found with a variance stabilizing transformation. We then applied the UMAP algorithm for non-linear dimensionality reduction into two dimensions. Cell cycle scores were also calculated for single cells based on the expression of canonical proliferation markers for S and G2M phases, using Seurat’s CellCycleScoring function. These scores were used in a regression model to reduce variance derived from cell cycle differences during data scaling, and subsequent dimensionality reduction steps were re-performed. All processing steps were performed with default parameters unless specified. We observed a high degree of separation between day 4 and day 6 samples in the low-dimensionality projection, suggesting a possible batch effect. We performed data integration using reciprocal PCA to correct technical variance while conservatively accounting for timepoint-specific transcriptional states. Integrated data were re-scaled and reduced to 30 principal components, then further reduced with UMAP for visualization in two dimensions, with default parameters
